# Binary-Search-Tree-In-Java
## Project Summary:
I programmed a classic binary search tree in Java. The _DefaultMap file contains the interface for key-value pairs and the _BST file contains the actual implementation of a binary search tree including methods such as removing a node from a tree, finding the minimum key value of a tree, and checking to see if a key is in the tree. The _BSTTest file contains the tests for the BST to ensure that all the methods are working properly.

This project utilized inheritance and exceptions along with a conceptual understanding of how binary search trees work. 

Testing was done using J-Unit testing.
