# Binary-Search-Tree-In-Java
## Project Summary:
I programmed a classic binary search tree in Java. The _DefaultMap file contains the interface for key-value pairs, the _BST file contains the actual implementation of a binary search tree including methods such as removing a node from a tree, finding the minimum key value of a tree, and checking to see if a key is in the tree. The _BSTTest file contains the tests for the BST to ensure that all the methods are working properly.

Inheritance, exceptions, and understanding of how binary search trees work were the main concepts applied in this project. 

Testing was done using J-Unit testing.
